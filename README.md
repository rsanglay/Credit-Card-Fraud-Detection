# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The purpose of this program is to build a machine learning model that can identify fraudulent credit card transactions based on patterns and anomalies in the data. The program uses a Decision Tree Classifier algorithm to train the model and evaluates its performance using accuracy and classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. The program also includes a graph plot to visualize the accuracy of the model on the training and testing sets.

What is the purpose of the program?

The purpose of the program is to help financial institutions detect fraudulent credit card transactions and prevent financial losses. By using machine learning algorithms to analyze large volumes of transaction data, financial institutions can identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity and take appropriate action.

What did we do to get the results?

To get the results, we first loaded a credit card transaction dataset from a CSV file and split it into training and testing sets. We then trained a Random Forest model on the training set, evaluated its performance on the testing set using accuracy and classification metrics, and visualized the accuracy using a graph plot.

Why is this useful to someone?

This program is useful to financial institutions that want to detect fraudulent credit card transactions and prevent financial losses. By using machine learning algorithms to analyze large volumes of transaction data, financial institutions can identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity and take appropriate action. Additionally, this program can serve as a starting point for further development of more sophisticated fraud detection systems that incorporate additional features and techniques.
